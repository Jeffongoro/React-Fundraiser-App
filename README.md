# React Fundraiser App

```bash
The app is created to make fundraising a seamless process where the goal,balance and contributions are displayed in real-time so that there is no need for a treasurer to do the math manually thus saving time and simplifying the process.

The App should be able to do the following;
1. Connect to the MPESA Api to retrieve real-time contributions,sum them up and display the figure.
2. compare real-time contributions against  the target and display the progress in terms of percentage.
```
